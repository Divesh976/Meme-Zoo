    <p id="overview"><font color=white>Our zoo was created in 69,420 BCE by the great Thirunama Selvan. This zoo is a living example of his values and morals. This zoo has been maintained throughout milleniums by his fans and disciples alike. Our zoo over the years has been the homes for many memes alike. Many of them are dangerous. Many are docile creatures. Our zoo saw its first major spike in visitors after we caught the legendary Kumalala savesta and quandale bingle(quandale dingle's father). We are greatly privileged in hosting our visitors and making familiar with the various sorts of creatures and memes at our zoo. There is a exception however every hundred years we hols a great ticket tour where we give the chosen guest the tour of the entire zoo. this trip is totally 69 days long. The winner is chosen through the great Thirunama lottery (Details provided at end of the page) </font></p><br><br><br><hr>
